# VT7

Seventh version of a vocab trainer based on a spaced-repetition algorithm. This version is developed again from scratch, so it will take some time before it is operational.

The project aims at implementing a simple, web-app based flashcarding app featuring space-repetition. It is aimed at but not restricted to language learners desirous to expand their vocabulary in a foreign language. The project originated from the creator not being satisfied by existing solutions, and wishes to provide the public with a good alternative.

This project is conducted by Johannes Lemonde. If you want to join the project, or in case of any doubts, contact me: jlemonde@guadjoma.xyz.
